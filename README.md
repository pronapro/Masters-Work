   1.   [UNET Architecture implementation](https://github.com/pronapro/Masters-Work/blob/main/Copy_of_U_net.ipynb)   

   2. [FCN Architecture implementation](https://github.com/pronapro/Masters-Work/blob/main/Fcn_architecture.ipynb)

## Objectives 
* Test Machine learning architetures 
* Central repo for code and functions
 
## Important things
### Functions 
* make sure the code is clean and understandable 
* The function is optimized and runs first
* Use function definitions and classes for reusability 

### Machine learning models 
Some of the important a things to note when testing the machine learning model.
* Model accuracy 
* Loss Function 
* How the model is trained 
* optimizers 
* Image of the architecture of the machine learning model used
