## Objectives 
* Test Machine learning architetures 
* Central repo for code and functions
 
## Important things
### Functions 
* make sure the code is clean and understandable 
* The function is optimized and runs first
* Use function definitions and classes for reusability 

### Machine learning models 
Some of the important a things to note when testing the machine learning model.
* Model accuracy 
* Loss Function 
* How the model is trained 
* optimizers 
* Image of the architecture of the machine learning model used
